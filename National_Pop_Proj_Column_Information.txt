Hispanic Origin for the United States: 2014 to 2060
File: 2014 National Population Projections
Source: U.S. Census Bureau, Population Division
Release date: December 2014
Sort order of observations: ORIGIN, RACE, SEX, and YEAR
Data fields (in order of appearance):
VARIABLE DESCRIPTION
ORIGIN Hispanic origin
RACE Race
SEX Sex
YEAR Year of projection (July 1, 2014 to July
1, 2060)
TOTAL_POP Population total (all ages combined) in
each year
(POP_0, POP_1, ...POP_99, POP_100) Population age x as of July 1 (columns
for ages 0, 1, 2, ...98, 99, 100 or more
years old)
The key for ORIGIN is as follows:
0 = Total
1 = Not Hispanic
2 = Hispanic
The key for RACE is as follows:
0 = All races (codes 1 through 6)
1 = White alone
2 = Black alone
3 = AIAN alone
4 = Asian alone
5 = NHPI alone
6 = Two or More Races
7 = White alone or in combination
8 = Black alone or in combination
9 = AIAN alone or in combination
10 = Asian alone or in combination
11 = NHPI alone or in combination
The key for SEX is as follows:
0 = Both sexes
1 = Male
2 = Female
NOTE: Hispanic origin is considered an ethnicity, not a race. Hispanics may
be of any race.'In combination' means in combination with one or more other races. The sum
of the five race groups (RACE codes 7 through 11) adds to more than the
total population because individuals may report more than one race.
The projections generally do not precisely agree with population estimates
available elsewhere on the Census Bureau website for methodological reasons.
Where both estimates and projections are available for a given time
reference, we recommend that you use the population estimates as the measure
of the current population.
ABBREVIATIONS: Black = Black or African American; AIAN = American Indian and
Alaska Native; NHPI = Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander
